Ex. 9/26/2017 need end date for 15 day stay
Need to know:
number of days in a month
Is it a leap year
 -list years in array
 -leap year base year - check every 4 years
 -year divisible by 4, but not 100

 Step 1: Get day of Date
 Step 2: Add number of days values
 Step 3: Compare new value with end of month
 Step 4: Keep if before or on last day of month
 Step 5: Get number of days past the last day of month
  5a: increment month
  5b: set month to January and increment year after December

Syntax for loop

//Start is integer to begin
//condition is when to complete the loop --> will do as long as condition is false
//statements to repeat included in curly braces
for (index = start; condition = stop; increment) {
}


//functions: named, anonymous, immediately invoked

//create a function that starts with a date, and a number of days to add to the Date
in order to generate an end date.


DOM Notes 10/17

DOM stores the information needed to load webpages in the form of Nodes in a tree
--> Top: WINDOW (put stuff on) & DOCUMENT (get stuff off) [Document child, window parent]
  --> html is included in DOM in tree-like structure
      --> parent, siblings, children

ex.               window
                    |
                document
                    |
                    html
      |                         |
    head                        body
|     |       |           |    |    |
title meta script       h1    p   button


DOM is great bc presents page, but also allows manipulation of page by querying DOM (getElementById)
  can manipulate DOM but MUST know how to query the DOM in order to manipulate

manipulation:
1. change information ex. Changing welcome message on hotel program
2. add new elements (this makes the page interactive) ex. based on mouse-over, click, etc.
3. remove elements (alter based on event that happens) ex. loading, hover, mouse, etc.

KEY in query -- must know structure, hierarchy, where items are located


use DOM to adjust page based on activity with user --> write out scenarios !!Due next Monday
ex. not enough room, change message text to red
    enough room, show make reservation button

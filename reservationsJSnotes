Need to know:
number of days in a month
Is it a leap year
 -list years in array
 -leap year base year - check every 4 years
 -year divisible by 4, but not 100

 Step 1: Get day of Date
 Step 2: Add number of days values
 Step 3: Compare new value with end of month
 Step 4: Keep if before or on last day of month
 Step 5: Get number of days past the last day of month

Syntax for loop

//Start is integer to begin
//condition is when to complete the loop --> will do as long as condition is false
//statements to repeat included in curly braces
for (index = start; condition = stop; increment) {
}


//functions: named, anonymous, immediately invoked

//create a function that starts with a date, and a number of days to add to the Date
in order to generate an end date.
